How to create and save any file using vi and vim command ?


BASIC Vi + Vim  operation  


[ root @ localhost ~ ] #  vim xyz

Press i to insert text into the file.

hello team....


Note:- How we can save and quit from the file

ESC  ==> to exit from the insert mode
:    ==> to run any command
w    ==>  write ( save )
q    ==>  quit 
!    ==>  Forcefully ( interactive ) 

How we can use these operators ..? 

ESC  + Shift

:q     [ quit without save ]

:w     [ save only ] 

:wq    [ save and quit ]   OR   ESC + Shift  + ZZ    OR     :x 

:q!    [ quit forcefully ]

:wq!   [ save and quit forcefully ]
